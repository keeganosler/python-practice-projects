# python-practice-projects

These are small projects used to practice my favourite programming language, Python.

## Codecademy Projects
These are small python projects inspired by the projects in Codecademy's Python 2 course.  They have been adapted to Python 3; the Codecademy Python 3 course costs money so I followed python 2.

## Codewars Projects
These are projects implemented in Python based on the weekly Codewars challenges.
